<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As of December 6, 2024, the NDSA Leadership unanimously voted to welcome its three most recent applicants into the membership.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Webrecorder LLC</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Museum of Glass</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">George Washington’s Mount Vernon</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each new member brings a host of skills and experience to our group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Webrecorder focuses on high-fidelity browser-based archiving, creating highly accurate archives of websites, which can then be replayed at a later time, including video, maps, 3D models, and other interactive elements that are fully intact. They support multi-level user access to utilize our tools, including open-source self-hosting, browser extensions, and paid services. Their engagement reaches across the globe, providing web archiving tools to grassroots organizations, data/science labs, journalists, archivists, GLAMS, and national organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Museum of Glass (MOG) is a premier contemporary art museum dedicated to glass and glassmaking in the West Coast’s largest and most active museum glass studio. MOG has an extensive collection of digital content dating back to its founding in 2002, including documentation of the over 2,000 pieces of art in the permanent collection and born-digital materials encompassing images, audio, and video recordings created over the past twenty years. These born-digital materials are critical documentation of the over 750 visiting artists in the MOG’s Hot Shop, related Hot Shop programming, and the exhibition and programming history of the Museum. A key part of this collection is an extensive amount of streaming video from the Hot Shop, where they broadcast live five days a week. In recent years, MOG has committed significant resources to establish its digital preservation program, including the hiring of the organization’s first digital archivist and archival assistant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">George Washington&#8217;s Mount Vernon is committed to building a robust digital preservation program and has taken significant steps in this direction over the past few years. They engaged a consulting firm to conduct an institution-wide digital archives assessment and hired a full-time digital records archivist. This role has been instrumental in developing our digital preservation policy and workflows, which ensure the preservation of born-digital materials, including institutional records, audiovisual materials, digital humanities projects, and web archiving. In the near future, they plan to expand our efforts to include 3D models and digital reproductions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each organization participates in one or more of the various interest and working groups – so keep an eye out for them on your calls and be sure to give them a shout-out. Please join me in welcoming our new members.
