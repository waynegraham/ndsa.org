<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Happy New Year! As we begin 2025, we wanted to take a moment to look back at what we’ve done over the past year. Please have a look at NDSA’s accomplishments – and feel free to </span><a href="mailto:ndsa.digipres@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">reach out to NDSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with any questions on how you can get involved!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA Leadership</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA Leadership has achieved significant milestones this year, with a focus on refining our mission and vision and growing NDSA into a more fully-fledged professional organization in response to members’ stated support needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In January 2024, NDSA Leadership released an RFI seeking expressions of interest from potential new host organizations. Over the course of the RFI process, we have been exploring alignment with other organizations, assessing their suitability as long-term hosts – and clarifying what NDSA can bring to the table for its host organization. To that end, in June 2024, we updated </span><a href="https://ndsa.org/about/foundational-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">NDSA’s foundational strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and outlined specific activities and initiatives to be completed in the next 3-5 years that will strengthen and stabilize NDSA’s shared governance, enhance membership services and outreach, and increase transparency through new communication strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the exploratory conversations kicked off through the RFI, in June we established a recurring monthly meeting with our prospective new host, with the goal of establishing a sustainable funding model and business plan. Together, we developed and conducted a </span><a href="https://ndsa.org//2024/08/20/member-fee-survey-feedback-requested.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">member fee survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to assess members’ willingness and ability to sustain the organization through various types of financial contributions. Preliminary analysis of the survey data supports a fee-for-membership model as one element of a set of diverse funding sources, and underlines NDSA’s need for financial resilience. We hope to release a fuller report documenting the survey findings in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Concurrently with the member fee survey, we also submitted a preliminary proposal for an IMLS planning grant in September. If awarded, the grant funding would allow NDSA to hire a part-time program coordinator who will assist with developing a business plan and transitioning NDSA to a fully self-funded model. We plan to begin drafting the full grant proposal soon, with anticipated milestones stretching into 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, NDSA Leadership is currently working on updated public governance documentation, integrating updates to bylaws and clarifying roles within the Coordinating Committee (CC). On the recommendation of the Membership Working Group, which suggested several improvements to the NDSA member experience, we have decided to add a CC Secretary role to oversee critical records, and we are establishing a Standing Membership Group that will focus on approving and onboarding new members – and supporting all NDSA members through enhanced outreach. Look for announcements about these efforts coming soon!</span></p>
